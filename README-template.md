## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to do simplier functions that can be reused for different purposes. Also learned how to disable a button and actived it afterwards.

### Continued development

JavaScript is still really hard for me. I have to spend so much time just understanding what a want to code before I even start.
